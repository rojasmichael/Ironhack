<article>My first thoughts that came to mine after I saw The Ultimate Gift; were great movie. I took my wife to view the movie on a Friday night; with about 60 other people in the movie. The plot, acting and story were amazing. It was everything I look for in a movie, Hollywood gets one right now and then, most of all it was clean and entertaining. The first words from my wife were - "one of the best movie we've seen".This was an amazing, life changing movie with values. It was very inspirational! When we saw it everyone around us loved it. It's more than a "must see" movie, it's an "I want to do better" movie. We would buy this movie, it's that good.</article>

<h3>Why I would recommend it</h3>

<p>This movie teaches alot. It shows what the true meaning of things are. We live in a world revolving around money and things. This movie teaches us differently.</p>
